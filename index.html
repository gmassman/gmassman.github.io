<p>Welcome to my website! Feel free to poke around and see some of my content and projects.</p>

<p>In early 2017 I moved from Tennessee to San Francisco. Currently, I work as a software engineer at Skupos where we build point-of-sale integrations for convenience stores. I mostly work on the back-end web services, but I have a reasonable amount of front-end experience as well. When I was hired, I helped build our version 1 dashboard in EmberJS. Now, most of my projects involve Ruby or Go, with a healthy dose of MySQL too.</p>

<p>Some of my hobbies include reading, writing, playing and listening to music and learning new technologies. I&rsquo;m a big fan of non-fiction, especially books that show me a new perspective. I also enjoy fiction and the occasional tv show. Over the past decade I&rsquo;ve written nearly 100 songs and about 150 poems. Links to some of them are scattered around this site.</p>
