      <description>My room with some light
 Cast from many angles
 Where they land and where it goes
 So some becomes more
 Something and something else
 Tile and grout
 Wall against will
 Twisting in fractals
 Approaching themselves
 And away from some simultaneously
 Smaller and smaller connections
 Closer and closer, denser and denser
 Left and right
 All my neighbors
 So the synapses evolve where quanta resides</description>

      <title>An Ode to Park Funding</title>

      <description>The ocean is salty
 And ships are at sea
 If the lighthouse were open
 How happy I&#39;d be
 But funding is missing
 We&#39;re locked out today
 We can&#39;t scale the lighthouse
 Cause Congress won&#39;t pay</description>

      <title>Non-profundities (from a Macbook)</title>

      <description>Most are a fan of far-fetched funny thoughts
 Some are well versed in profundities
 Some more get a kick out of anything
 Like me; I am fond of non-profundities
 What is it like to enjoy almost anything?
 Any a thing and a thought come to mind
 Except for pain and the loss and depression
 That once was my default, but I did subside</description>

      <title>The Soldier</title>

      <description>The soldier follows orders
 He does not question his commander
 His job is well defined - do what you&#39;re told
 He has no inherent direction,
 No goals or aspirations
 He is a machine, ready to be programmed
 When his training is complete, he can operate without fear or doubt.
 His goals are not his, they are predetermined.
 His general calls the shots, he simply aims and pulls the trigger.</description>

      <description>Welcome to my website! Feel free to poke around and see some of my content and projects. I also have a resume if you&amp;rsquo;re interested in that sort of thing.
In early 2017 I moved from Tennessee to San Francisco. Currently I work as a software engineer at Skupos, where we build point-of-sale integrations for convenience stores. I mostly work on the backend web services, but I have a reasonable amount of frontend experience as well.</description>

      <description>I haven&#39;t done so and such in a little while
 What&#39;s a once in a while that is any more than a little?
 It must be a long while, longer than the littlest little while
 A cardinality all its own, an infinity of sorts
 Discovered once a moment
 Infinitesimally summed across a minute
 Integral to all we&#39;ve been through
 All we&#39;ll be through</description>

      <title>Getting Started with Traveling Ultralight</title>

      <description>I’m on a trip at the moment, and a friend who generously let me sleep on his couch looked at my small travel backpack and commented on how little I travel with: “That’s impressive,” he said.
I was a little surprised, because though I’ve gotten that comment before, it’s become normal for me to travel with just a small bag (10 lbs. or less, usually), and I have friends who travel with even less.</description>

      <title>How I Learned to Stop Procrastinating, &amp; Love Letting Go</title>
      <link>https://garrettmassman.com/example_posts/post-3/</link>

      <description>The end of procrastination is the art of letting go.
I’ve been a lifelong procrastinator, at least until recent years. I would put things off until deadline, because I knew I could come through. I came through on tests after cramming last minute, I turned articles in at the deadline after waiting until the last hour, I got things done.
Until I didn’t. It turns out procrastinating caused me to miss deadlines, over and over.</description>

      <title>Fearlessness: How to Stop Running from Space</title>
      <link>https://garrettmassman.com/example_posts/post-2/</link>

      <description>We spend our days filling in every available space, cramming in more tasks, responding to messages, checking social media and online sites, watching videos.
We are afraid of empty space in our lives.
The result is often a continual busyness, constant distraction and avoidance, lack of focus, lack of satisfaction with our lives.
We run from silence. We run from the spaces between tasks and appointments. We run from solitude and stillness.</description>

      <description>You have a to-do list that scrolls on for days. You are managing multiple projects, getting lots of email and messages on different messaging systems, managing finances and personal health habits and so much more.
It all keeps piling up, and it can feel overwhelming.
How do you keep up with it all? How do you find focus and peace and get stuff accomplished when you have too much on your plate?</description>
