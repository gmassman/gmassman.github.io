Some are well versed in profundities
Some more get a kick out of anything
Like me; I am fond of non-profundities

What is it like to enjoy almost anything?
Any a thing and a thought come to mind
Except for pain and the loss and depression
That once was my default, but I did subside

Not over, not under, achievements placate
But once in a while, our motive ain’t great
The money comes rollin’, the paper comes too
The data and doxing of not thorough you

For that was the code, the commits I made
Was sold to the big wigs with whiskers and shades
Cause big is the landscape, and large was the loan
They&#39;re dippin’ and puffin’ their way to the throne

Anything comes back to my front of mind
A path, a profession, not bold but quite wide
And now is the moment I wish more and more
My focus would narrow to where I’m bound for

With so much to learn, and so much to write
These ideas are seedlings, and purpose their might
I may not be cut out for retailed reports
But tail still, I wail still… with -f of course

So more on the details, which ones are they?
The bio, the neuro, the computer-say?
What GPUs, sensors and math is that way?
What questions am I too stupid to ask?

There’s nerves and there&#39;s gas, there&#39;s food and there’s poo
And who understand it all? Less than a few
Should I be a physiologist at my core?
Or just a male scientist… wouldn’t that be a bore

Dr. Dobro is a hell of a name
And what of my future? A bluegrassy fame!
There’s more of it left, but a name I can make
For myself from my work, learn to give for my sake

The Knights and the Bezos’ out in the world
They’re making a killing, they’re reeling it in
A Phil and a Morris are spending before us
They live for the dollar, and off their own sin

But I will not waste for a speedier shoe
I will not huff or be puffin’ with you
My time here has ended, a new one&#39;s begun
I’m blessed with the skill to make science, for one</pre></div>
