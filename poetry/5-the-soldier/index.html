<span class="mdx-poem--line">The soldier follows orders<br></span>
<span class="mdx-poem--line">He does not question his commander<br></span>
<span class="mdx-poem--line">His job is well defined - do what you're told<br></span>
<span class="mdx-poem--line">He has no inherent direction,<br></span>
<span class="mdx-poem--line">No goals or aspirations<br></span>
<span class="mdx-poem--line">He is a machine, ready to be programmed<br></span>
<span class="mdx-poem--line">When his training is complete, he can operate without fear or doubt.<br></span>
<span class="mdx-poem--line">His goals are not his, they are predetermined.<br></span>
<span class="mdx-poem--line">His general calls the shots, he simply aims and pulls the trigger.<br></span>
</p><p class="mdx-poem--stanza">
<span class="mdx-poem--line">The soldier is a strong man<br></span>
<span class="mdx-poem--line">Emotionless to all observers<br></span>
<span class="mdx-poem--line">Ostensibly aware that each decision is preprogrammed,<br></span>
<span class="mdx-poem--line">Each outcome is the roll of a die.<br></span>
<span class="mdx-poem--line">Live or die, he cannot say<br></span>
<span class="mdx-poem--line">Nor does he have a preference.<br></span>
<span class="mdx-poem--line">Carrying out orders is his duty<br></span>
<span class="mdx-poem--line">And putting himself in front of bullets is an order.<br></span>
</p><p class="mdx-poem--stanza">
<span class="mdx-poem--line">His general was once a soldier<br></span>
<span class="mdx-poem--line">Now he gives the commands.<br></span>
<span class="mdx-poem--line">He learned long ago that free thought is anti-productive<br></span>
<span class="mdx-poem--line">For if he were to think freely, his soldiers would have no reason to follow orders.<br></span>
<span class="mdx-poem--line">The general is still a soldier<br></span>
</p><p class="mdx-poem--stanza">
<span class="mdx-poem--line">Others may question the soldier's actions.<br></span>
<span class="mdx-poem--line">They'll jeer and point and call him a conformist incapable of abstract thought<br></span>
<span class="mdx-poem--line">A mindless creature made to march for his entire life<br></span>
<span class="mdx-poem--line">Never to question why his path is drawn from point A to point B<br></span>
<span class="mdx-poem--line">But he will get a promotion and maybe become a general one day.<br></span>
</p><p class="mdx-poem--stanza">
<span class="mdx-poem--line">Then the Soldier will understand what it means to lead, because he is the ultimate follower.<br></span>
