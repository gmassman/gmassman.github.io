			<div class="highlight"><pre style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4">The soldier follows orders
He does not question his commander
His job is well defined - do what you&#39;re told
He has no inherent direction,
No goals or aspirations
He is a machine, ready to be programmed
When his training is complete, he can operate without fear or doubt.
His goals are not his, they are predetermined.
His general calls the shots, he simply aims and pulls the trigger.

The soldier is a strong man
Emotionless to all observers
Ostensibly aware that each decision is preprogrammed,
Each outcome is the roll of a die.
Live or die, he cannot say
Nor does he have a preference.
Carrying out orders is his duty
And putting himself in front of bullets is an order.

His general was once a soldier
Now he gives the commands.
He learned long ago that free thought is anti-productive
For if he were to think freely, his soldiers would have no reason to follow orders.
The general is still a soldier

Others may question the soldier&#39;s actions.
They&#39;ll jeer and point and call him a conformist incapable of abstract thought 
A mindless creature made to march for his entire life
Never to question why his path is drawn from point A to point B
But he will get a promotion and maybe become a general one day.

Then the Soldier will understand what it means to lead, because he is the ultimate follower.</pre></div>
