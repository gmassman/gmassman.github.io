<span class="mdx-poem--line">Back in the 50s, one man had a great message.<br></span>
<span class="mdx-poem--line">He heard it from his father when he was a kid, and it shaped the way he viewed the world.<br></span>
<span class="mdx-poem--line">When it was time for college, a war was raging overseas.<br></span>
<span class="mdx-poem--line">He knew he could make a great impact by sharing his message.<br></span>
<span class="mdx-poem--line">He would clothe the needy, show the lost God's Way.<br></span>
</p><p class="mdx-poem--stanza">
<span class="mdx-poem--line">So he studied theology<br></span>
<span class="mdx-poem--line">And went on to seminary<br></span>
<span class="mdx-poem--line">Where he learned the Word<br></span>
<span class="mdx-poem--line">And memorized the Scriptures<br></span>
<span class="mdx-poem--line">Verse by verse, chapter by chapter<br></span>
<span class="mdx-poem--line">This young man discovered his new voice<br></span>
<span class="mdx-poem--line">One that was unioned with the Holy Spirit<br></span>
<span class="mdx-poem--line">And resonated with the Truth.<br></span>
</p><p class="mdx-poem--stanza">
<span class="mdx-poem--line">He honed this new voice by giving sermons<br></span>
<span class="mdx-poem--line">Every Sunday at a local Methodist church<br></span>
<span class="mdx-poem--line">He joined just as their elderly pastor was retiring<br></span>
<span class="mdx-poem--line">And all the members loved him<br></span>
<span class="mdx-poem--line">Even though they knew he was only an interim leader<br></span>
<span class="mdx-poem--line">The adults respected his voice,<br></span>
<span class="mdx-poem--line">And the children followed his advice.<br></span>
</p><p class="mdx-poem--stanza">
<span class="mdx-poem--line">He began courting a young woman in town<br></span>
<span class="mdx-poem--line">Queer as it may seem, she was a devout Baptist<br></span>
<span class="mdx-poem--line">But they agreed on the important things<br></span>
<span class="mdx-poem--line">Like the sanctity of marriage,<br></span>
<span class="mdx-poem--line">The value of abstinence,<br></span>
<span class="mdx-poem--line">And the importance of family and community.<br></span>
</p><p class="mdx-poem--stanza">
<span class="mdx-poem--line">One night in a dream he heard the voice of God<br></span>
<span class="mdx-poem--line">It called him to leave Indiana<br></span>
<span class="mdx-poem--line">And go south to Tennessee<br></span>
<span class="mdx-poem--line">Where he was to become the founder of a Baptist church<br></span>
<span class="mdx-poem--line">He was to marry his sweetheart and take her with him.<br></span>
</p><p class="mdx-poem--stanza">
<span class="mdx-poem--line">After fifteen months leading the Methodist worshipers<br></span>
<span class="mdx-poem--line">He and his newly wed set off to find their new home<br></span>
<span class="mdx-poem--line">They called it Stoney Brook Baptist Church<br></span>
<span class="mdx-poem--line">It became a staple of the town's good faith.<br></span>
</p><p class="mdx-poem--stanza">
<span class="mdx-poem--line">For fifty six years that pastor gave his Sunday sermons<br></span>
<span class="mdx-poem--line">To a congregation that peaked at two-hundred seventy in 1972<br></span>
<span class="mdx-poem--line">He touched many hearts and loved all who walked through his sanctuary doors.<br></span>
</p><p class="mdx-poem--stanza">
<span class="mdx-poem--line">On the day of his last sermon, he thanked God for a life of blessings<br></span>
<span class="mdx-poem--line">He stood before a crowd of twenty, his wife and two daughters were there.<br></span>
</p><p class="mdx-poem--stanza">
<span class="mdx-poem--line">After the old man retired, the church closed its doors.<br></span>
</p><p class="mdx-poem--stanza">
<span class="mdx-poem--line">In 2010, a megachurch bought Stoney Brook Baptist.<br></span>
<span class="mdx-poem--line">They renamed it The Point at Stoney Brook, praying it would be a staple of Southern revival.<br></span>
<span class="mdx-poem--line">The new pastor was a man of vigour and Godly passion.<br></span>
<span class="mdx-poem--line">He was inspired by that great Methodist preacher he saw as a child.<br></span>
<span class="mdx-poem--line">The one that went on to found a church in Tennessee.<br></span>
</p><p class="mdx-poem--stanza">
