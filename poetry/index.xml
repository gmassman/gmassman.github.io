      <description>The ocean is salty And ships are at sea If the lighthouse were open How happy I&amp;#39;d be But funding is missing We&amp;#39;re locked out today We can&amp;#39;t scale the lighthouse Cause Congress won&amp;#39;t pay</description>

      <description>Most are a fan of far-fetched funny thoughts Some are well versed in profundities Some more get a kick out of anything Like me; I am fond of non-profundities What is it like to enjoy almost anything? Any a thing and a thought come to mind Except for pain and the loss and depression That once was my default, but I did subside Not over, not under, achievements placate But once in a while, our motive ain’t great The money comes rollin’, the paper comes too The data and doxing of not thorough you For that was the code, the commits I made Was sold to the big wigs with whiskers and shades Cause big is the landscape, and large was the loan They&amp;#39;re dippin’ and puffin’ their way to the throne Anything comes back to my front of mind A path, a profession, not bold but quite wide And now is the moment I wish more and more My focus would narrow to where I’m bound for With so much to learn, and so much to write These ideas are seedlings, and purpose their might I may not be cut out for retailed reports But tail still, I wail still… with -f of course So more on the details, which ones are they?</description>

      <description>I haven&amp;#39;t done so and such in a little while What&amp;#39;s a once in a while that is any more than a little? It must be a long while, longer than the littlest little while A cardinality all its own, an infinity of sorts Discovered once a moment Infinitesimally summed across a minute Integral to all we&amp;#39;ve been through All we&amp;#39;ll be through All we&amp;#39;ll be In obsession comes regression From the short engaged the long Here&amp;#39;s a section unimpressioned Here&amp;#39;s a fraction never wrong What is written to and from here Where it&amp;#39;s leading, where it&amp;#39;s been Which arrangement it&amp;#39;s preceding Why it&amp;#39;s designed just to win</description>
