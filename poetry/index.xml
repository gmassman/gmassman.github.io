      <title>Self Restoration</title>

      <description>There&#39;s something in me bottled up
 It&#39;s amorphous, swimming around
 My soul and guts, my white and black matter
 It&#39;s rising to the surface, grasping for air
 Pressuring the vacuum seal to break
 Day and night it lingers, lingers, lingers
 It&#39;s been years since last I wept
 And felt my most sincerest self
 Habits change, memories remain
 Tonight I&#39;m sweating through my sheets</description>

      <description>Specks of light glinter on the water&#39;s surface
 As I close my eyes in meditation
 Breathing deeply, warm air fills my lungs
 Drifting inot the lake&#39;s call of calmness
 Minutes pass as air goes in and out
 Feeling more aware of life around me
 Fish are swimming, bees and birds are singing
 An old man is whistling on the dock
 Separating from the world around me</description>

      <title>Times Like These (For George Floyd)</title>

      <description>At times like these I want to shout
 And get all of my anger out
 I&#39;ll let the Earth absorb my wrath
 And scare those standing in my path
 At times like these I want to fight
 To show my enemies I&#39;m right
 I&#39;ll wager war and bet I&#39;ll win
 A bargain for my next of kin
 At times like these I want to loot</description>

      <description>What waves that were rolling and splashing ashore
 What winds that were raging the coastline that day
 What ocean gargantuan, waters that tore
 Their houses to rubble, their homes washed away
 The fires that burned in the forests so dry
 The flames in the country continued for weeks
 The damage was dealt and the families cried
 As smoke filled the air over valleys and peaks</description>

      <title>To the Point</title>

      <description>Back in the 50s, one man had a great message.
 He heard it from his father when he was a kid, and it shaped the way he viewed the world.
 When it was time for college, a war was raging overseas.
 He knew he could make a great impact by sharing his message.
 He would clothe the needy, show the lost God&#39;s Way.
 So he studied theology</description>

      <description>Life as it happened today, led me to smoking a bowl
 So some say unkindness is always my way,
 Were I to yield, I&#39;d be yielding... so what?
 I can&#39;t say since I am uncertain my pay,
 How to make better verse, a better made way
 Towards I/O Pins, and make more true say.
 There&#39;s some things that haven&#39;t been learned yet, there&#39;s mysteries out in the world</description>

      <title>Grey Mind</title>

      <description>My room with some light
 Cast from many angles
 Where they land and where it goes
 So some becomes more
 Something and something else
 Tile and grout
 Wall against will
 Twisting in fractals
 Approaching themselves
 And away from some simultaneously
 Smaller and smaller connections
 Closer and closer, denser and denser
 Left and right
 All my neighbors
 So the synapses evolve where quanta resides</description>

      <title>An Ode to Park Funding</title>

      <description>The ocean is salty
 And ships are at sea
 If the lighthouse were open
 How happy I&#39;d be
 But funding is missing
 We&#39;re locked out today
 We can&#39;t scale the lighthouse
 Cause Congress won&#39;t pay</description>

      <title>Non-profundities (from a Macbook)</title>
      <link>https://garrettmassman.com/poetry/3-non-profundities/</link>

      <description>Most are a fan of far-fetched funny thoughts
 Some are well versed in profundities
 Some more get a kick out of anything
 Like me; I am fond of non-profundities
 What is it like to enjoy almost anything?
 Any a thing and a thought come to mind
 Except for pain and the loss and depression
 That once was my default, but I did subside</description>

      <title>The Soldier</title>
      <link>https://garrettmassman.com/poetry/5-the-soldier/</link>

      <description>The soldier follows orders
 He does not question his commander
 His job is well defined - do what you&#39;re told
 He has no inherent direction,
 No goals or aspirations
 He is a machine, ready to be programmed
 When his training is complete, he can operate without fear or doubt.
 His goals are not his, they are predetermined.
 His general calls the shots, he simply aims and pulls the trigger.</description>

      <title>While True</title>

      <description>I haven&#39;t done so and such in a little while
 What&#39;s a once in a while that is any more than a little?
 It must be a long while, longer than the littlest little while
 A cardinality all its own, an infinity of sorts
 Discovered once a moment
 Infinitesimally summed across a minute
 Integral to all we&#39;ve been through
 All we&#39;ll be through</description>
